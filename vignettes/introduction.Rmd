## Differences with Observable Plot

- `data` can be declared in `obsplot()` and inherited by the following marks.
- if a channel is given as a vector, a `data` index of the same length is automatically added.
- if a channel is considered as data and of size 1, it will be rep()ed to the greatest other data element.
- to force a single element to be considered as data, use `as_data` (instead of `[]` in JavaScript).

- transforms : by default first argument is output. If several outputs, or if outputs and options have an argument with the same name, use `list()` to differentiate between both.

## Dealing with date and time data

- converted automatically if of type `Date` or `POSIXt`.
