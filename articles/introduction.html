<p><code>obsplot</code> is an R package that allows to use the <a href="https://observablehq.com/@observablehq/plot">Observable Plot</a> library to create charts as HTML widgets. Observable Plot is a free, open-source JavaScript visualisation library developed by <a href="https://observablehq.com/@mbostock">Mike Bostock</a> and <a href="https://observablehq.com/@fil/">Philippe Rivière</a> at <a href="https://observablehq.com/">Observable</a>.</p>

<h2 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#a-word-of-caution" class="anchor"></a>A word of caution</h2>
<p><code>obsplot</code> is still in an early stage, in particular its API could change in the future, either for self improvements or to follow Observable Plot evolutions. It may not be suitable for production right now.</p>
<p>Also to be considered, <code>obsplot</code> is not suitable for charting very large datasets : the generated plots are in SVG format, and when using it in RMarkdown or Shiny the underlying data are included in the output as JSON.</p>

<a href="#getting-started" class="anchor"></a>Getting started</h2>
<p>Suppose we want to create a very simple dot chart from the <code>penguins</code> dataset of the <code>palmerpenguins</code> package :</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb4"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span class="kw"><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/library.html">library</a></span><span class="op">(</span><span class="va"><a href="https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/">palmerpenguins</a></span><span class="op">)</span>
<span class="fu"><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/utils/data.html">data</a></span><span class="op">(</span><span class="va">penguins</span><span class="op">)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>To create such a chart we first initialise it with <code><a href="../reference/obsplot.html">obsplot()</a></code>. We pass as argument the data frame containing the data to plot :</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb5"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span class="fu"><a href="../reference/obsplot.html">obsplot</a></span><span class="op">(</span><span class="va">penguins</span><span class="op">)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>We then add a graphical mark to create our chart. Here we use the dot mark by piping the <code>mark_dot</code> function. We pass as arguments the <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> <em>channels</em> giving the corresponding data frame columns :</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb6"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span class="fu"><a href="../reference/obsplot.html">obsplot</a></span><span class="op">(</span><span class="va">penguins</span><span class="op">)</span> |&gt;
    <span class="fu"><a href="../reference/mark_area.html">mark_dot</a></span><span class="op">(</span>x <span class="op">=</span> <span class="va">bill_length_mm</span>, y <span class="op">=</span> <span class="va">bill_depth_mm</span><span class="op">)</span></code></pre></div>

<a href="#marks" class="anchor"></a>Marks</h2>
<p><a href="https://observablehq.com/@observablehq/plot-marks?collection=@observablehq/plot">Marks</a> are the fundamental building blocks of Observable Plot charts. Each mark is a graphical representation of some data under a specific form : dot, line, area, text…</p>
<p>In Observable Plot, marks are defined by giving a <code>marks</code> JavaScript array to the <code>Plot.plot()</code> function. In <code>obsplot</code>, it is done by piping one or more of the <code>mark_*</code> family of functions. In the following example we add three different marks to create a scatterplot with two rules for <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> mean values :</p>

mark function takes several arguments. The first one is an optional <code>data</code> object. If not specified, it is inherited from the one passed to <code>obsplot</code>. Other named arguments are called mark constructors and can be of several types :</p>
<ul>
<li>a <em>column channel</em>, ie the name of a column of <code>data</code>, as a string (<code>"col"</code>) or a symbol (<code>col</code>)</li>
<li>a <em>vector channel</em>, ie raw data to be plotted, in general as a vector</li>
<li>a <em>constant option</em>, which defines an option (such as size, color…) globally in the same way for all mark elements</li>
<li>JavaScript code, defined with the <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/pkg/htmlwidgets/man/JS.html">JS()</a></code> function, evaluated at runtime</li>
</ul>
<p>In the following example, both <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> are column channels, whereas <code>stroke</code> is a constant. In fact values passed to a color constructor (<code>stroke</code> or <code>fill</code>) are automatically considered as constant if they look like a CSS color name or definition.</p>

<ul>
<li>If it is a call to <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/pkg/htmlwidgets/man/JS.html">JS()</a></code>, it is JavaScript code</li>
<li>If it is a single symbol, it is considered a column channel if the symbol name matches a data column. Otherwise it is seen as an object in the calling environment</li>
<li>If it is a vector of length &gt; 1, it is considered as a vector channel</li>
<li>If it is a single number, it is considered as a vector channel except for <code>r</code>, <code>strikeOpacity</code>,<code>fillOpacity</code>, <code>fontSize</code> and <code>rotate</code>
</li>
<li>If it is a single character string, it is considered a column channel except if it is a CSS color for <code>fill</code> and <code>stroke</code>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You can explicitly specify that a channel is a vector channel by using the <code><a href="../reference/as_data.html">as_data()</a></code> helper function. In the following example, without <code>as_data</code> the code would raise an error as it would look for a <code>"Paris"</code> column in the data :</p>

<a href="#faceting" class="anchor"></a>Faceting</h2>
<p><a href="https://observablehq.com/@observablehq/plot-facets?collection=@observablehq/plot">Faceting</a> allows to create a grid of comparable grouped charts. In Observable Plot faceting is used by adding a <code>facet</code> option to <code>Plot.plot()</code>. In <code>obsplot</code> it is achieved by piping the <code>facet</code> function.</p>
<p>Here, we create an horizontal set of scatterplots by passing an <code>x</code> channel to <code><a href="../reference/facet.html">facet()</a></code> :</p>

<a href="#scales" class="anchor"></a>Scales</h2>
<p><a href="https://observablehq.com/@observablehq/plot-scales?collection=@observablehq/plot">Scales</a> is a family of functions which allow to modify the way a data value is mapped to a visual attribute such as position, size or color.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>scale_color</code></li>
<li><code>scale_fx</code></li>
<li><code>scale_fy</code></li>
<li><code>scale_opacity</code></li>
<li><code>scale_r</code></li>
<li><code>scale_x</code></li>
<li><code>scale_y</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Modifying scales in <code>obsplot</code> is done by piping one of the <code>scale_</code> family of functions :</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>scale_x</code> and <code>scale_y</code> allow to change the <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> scales</li>
<li>
<code>scale_color</code> and <code>scale_opacity</code> modify the mappings on <code>fill</code>, <code>stroke</code>, <code>fillOpacity</code> and <code>strokeOpacity</code> channels</li>
<li>
<code>scale_r</code> modifies the scale of the radius <code>r</code> channel</li>
<li>
<code>scale_fx</code> and <code>scale_fy</code> are used to modify the band scales added when using faceting</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, we could modify the <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> scales to become logarithmic and change their labels:</p>

<a href="#transform-functions" class="anchor"></a>Transform functions</h3>
<p>Transform functions are a set of functions which takes mark channels and options as input and compute a new set of channels and options. They are used, for example, to bin data to create an histogram, group them to compute a bar chart, etc.</p>
<p>In Observable Plot, transforms are functions (<code>Plot.bin</code>, <code>Plot.windowX</code>…) passed as option to a mark. In <code>obsplot</code>, a corresponding transform function (<code><a href="../reference/transform_bin.html">transform_bin()</a></code>, <code><a href="../reference/transform_windowX.html">transform_windowX()</a></code>) is called and passed as argument to a mark function.</p>
<p>For example, if we want to create an histogram, we have to apply binning by calling <code>transform_binX</code> inside a <code>mark_rectY</code> :</p>

<a href="#from-r-to-javascript" class="anchor"></a>From R to JavaScript</h3>
<p>Data conversion from R to JavaScript is handled by <code>htmlwidgets</code> via JSON serialization. As a general rule, a data.frame in R is converted to a <code>d3</code> style data array (an array of objects), a <code>list</code> in R is converted to an object, a vector of size &gt; 1 is converted to an array, and a vector of size 1 is converted to a number or character string.</p>
<p><code>obsplot</code> includes some helpers to automatically detect when an object is of class <code>Date</code> or <code>POSIXt</code>, and convert it to back a JavaScript <code>Date</code> object.</p>

<div id="differences-with-observable-plot" class="section level3">
<h3 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#differences-with-observable-plot" class="anchor"></a>Differences with Observable Plot</h3>
<p>There are several differences between <code>obsplot</code> and Observable Plot, mainly :</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>data</code> can be declared in <code><a href="../reference/obsplot.html">obsplot()</a></code> and inherited by the chart marks, whereas in Observable Plot it must be declared for each mark.</li>
<li>if a channel is given as a vector channel (a vector) and no <code>data</code> has been declared, an indexed <code>data</code> argument of the same length is automatically added.</li>
<li>if a channel is considered as data and of size 1, it will be replicated to the length of the greatest other vector channel (if possible).</li>
<li>to force a single element to be considered as data and not as a column name, you must use <code><a href="../reference/as_data.html">as_data()</a></code> in <code>obsplot</code> instead of <code>[]</code> in JavaScript.</li>
<li>for transform functions that accept both outputs (or map) and options arguments, the first argument is automatically considered as the output (or the map), whereas in Observable Plot you must specify two distinct objects.</li>
</ul>

<h4 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#data-preselection" class="anchor"></a>Data preselection</h4>
<p>When the plotted data are stored in a data frame, <code>obsplot</code> has currently no way to determine which columns are used or not. This is not a problem in an interactive session, but when used in an RMarkdown document, the whole dataset will be embedded in the output document in JSON format, which can make the document size go up quickly.</p>
<p>One solution is to preselect the needed data in R before calling <code>obsplot</code> :</p>
